This repository contains my homework submissions to the problem sets for the [Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning](http://www.ttic.edu/courses/#ml) class I took at [TTIC](http://www.ttic.edu/) while a Graduate Student at the University of Chicago.

[Prof. Gregory Shakhnarovich](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~gregory/) taught the class.

This repository serves as as a contribution to my portfolio in the realm of Machine Learning.
